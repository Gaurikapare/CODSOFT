# CodSoft Python Programming Internship Projects
<h3>  OVERVIEW </h3>
"This repository features projects I developed during my Python programming internship at CodSoft.
The projects include a basic calculator, a password generator, and a rock-paper-scissors game, each demonstrating various core aspects of Python programming, such as handling user input, utilizing conditionals and loops, and incorporating Python libraries."


### Basic Calculator
A command-line calculator designed to perform essential arithmetic operations interactively.

#### Features
- Supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Provides error handling for division by zero, displaying a clear error message.
- Allows users to exit the calculator anytime by typing 'exit'.
- Continuously prompts for new calculations until 'exit' is entered.
